# Git Cheetsheet

**Basics**

1. Initialize repository with `git init`
2. Create project files + and use text editor (e.g. VSCode) to edit contents
3. Check status of those files with `git status` for staging and git dif for working tree
4. Stage changes for commit with `git add <>`
5. Commit staged changes to version history with `git commit`
6. View previous changes with `git log`


**Branching**

1. See which branch we are working on with `git branch` or `git log`
2. Create new branches with `git branch <>` or `git checkout -b <>`
3. Merge in changes of branch name 'x' to current branch with `git merge x`
